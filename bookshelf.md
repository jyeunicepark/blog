I always read, or at least always carry a book or two. Some are great, some are absolutely horrendous, some are not my cup of tea. 

I have been trying to come up with a nice list of books now and then to share with my friends and family. And below is the result thereof. 

I also secretly keep a list of DO NOT READ books, but... that'll be for another time
