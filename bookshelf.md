If you know me, you'd know I love to read. 

"사람이 책을 만들고 책이 사람을 만든다 (Men make books and books make men)." 

This is a quote engraved in a large stone set upon the entrance of what is known as a hallmark bookshop at the center of Seoul city. 

I truly believe in the power of reading, and the development/enrichment it can bring about in humanity. 

When I first learned about the Great Books program offered by St. John's College, I knew it was the education that I needed so badly, but I was more than half way through my bachelor's degree in HK, plus flying to US for another degree at the time wasn't feasible. 

So I made the decision to take it up to my own hands and devise my own Great Books program (at least in its format for now). 

Below is a list of books I have read since 2018, which was when I started to challenge myself to read at least 30 books a year. 

If my initial goal was to read more, the next was to read more and widely, and now it is to read widely and also in depth. 

I am still struggling to incorporate the Classics which are the tenements of St John's Great Books program, but will surely read at least 5 books (excluding the Bible, both Old and New Testament, which I read daily as a Christian).
