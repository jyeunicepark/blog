###About
You'd think you would know yourself well enough until you have to write an About Me page. 

Tough, but here are the things you should probably know about me: 

1. Name - Eunice; Age - 23; Nationality - Korean;
2. Lately obsessed with post-workout banana smoothies. YUM. 
3. I try to give most of my time and attention to reading. Books, articles, essays, news, the back of the cereal boxes, you name it. If there are words on it, count me in. 
4. I studied hotel management for my undergraduate degree. 
5. Decided I was not passionate/suited to take it up as seriously as a career. And it's okay, I haven't figured out what I like / what I'm good at, but at least those four years was lots of fun. 
6. I don't like to define myself by the job title, but I work for a financial services company as a financial data associate. 
7. I have been accepted to study Information Systems Management as a part-time student this coming fall!! And plan to either become a data scientist or someone who knows how to code. 
8. If you believe in MBTI, I'm an ESFJ. If you don't, I'm an ESFJ, what's [yours](www.16personalities.com)?  
9. Congratulations for making this far. You probably know me more than 60% of my friends do --- they don't care. 
10. I love learning, and this is my journey of growth. I'm glad you took the time to stop by and witness it. Have a great day :)
