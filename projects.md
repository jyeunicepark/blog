### Projects 

Here are a few projects related to data analytics / cleaning I've completed 

You can see them [here](https://github.com/jyeunicepark). 

In learning how to code, my goal is to: 

- keep track of all the projects worked on during school years (2021-2023)
- work on at least 5 business application projects in 2021
- become comfortable in data cleaning (Python) for data analysis  
- know how to perform web scraping 
- use Python & SQL to visualize data findings
