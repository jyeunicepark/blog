### Projects 

Here are a few projects related to data analytics I've completed 

You can see them [here](https://github.com/jyeunicepark). 

Through my journey on learning how to code, my goals are to: 

- practice data cleaning (Python) for data analysis  
- perform web scraping 
- use Python & SQL to visualize data findings
- keep track of all the projects worked on during school years (2021-2023) 
- consolidate and arrange projects so github can become a portfolio
