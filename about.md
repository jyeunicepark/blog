About

Hi, my name is Eunice Park. I live in HK, and majored in Hotel Management. Loved it but decided not to take it seriously as a career. 
I currently work as a financial data associate at a financial services company. 
I just started to learn how to code and will be enrolling Information Systems Mgt (part-time) this fall.
