About

Hi, my name is Eunice Park. I live in HK and work full-time as a financial data associate. 

I just started to learn how to code and will be enrolling Information Systems Mgt (part-time) this fall. 

I also love reading/writing, and this is where I will share my books, my projects, and my thoughts.
